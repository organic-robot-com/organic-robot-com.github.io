Organic Robot is a small team of professional Software Engineers. The team was created to allow it's members release applications. These applications typically start as side-projects but have evolved to the point where they would be useful to other users.

The team has an ethos of simplicity, transparency and limited device access. That means, all our applications should:

* be easy to use,
* transparent in how they operate,
* and require only absolutely necessary device permissions - this point is particularly relevant mobile device applications.
