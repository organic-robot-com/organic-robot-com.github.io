Organic Robot is a release alias for a collection of applications. These applications
typically start as side-projects but have evolved to the point where they, at least in
my humble opinion, would be useful to other users.

The list of projects includes:

* [QR Scanner App](/qr-scanner/)
* [Homelab](/homelab/)
